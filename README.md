Wine Analysis

This repository contains my project where I did clustering on a Wine dataset. Project Overview: The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of clustering models in effectively grouping together similar wines. I checked the performance of the models using the silhouette metric. The dependencies I used python and various packages within it for the project. I did my analysis in Jupyter Notebooks.
